# Tune It

  - Tune It is a web application which is integrated with Google Oauth 2.0 for user authentication, securely storing sensitive information (like access   token, refresh tokens, username, email) in cookies.

- Utilized YouTube Data API to fetch and display authenticated users playlist data.
- This project brought together everything I learned about managing cookies, handling Oauth 2.0 and working with APIs.
